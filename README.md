## ‚öíÔ∏è Setup

1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org) on your device
2. Install two required Python packages by running:

```
python -m pip install requests
python -m pip install rich
```

- The python script `create_list.py` can be used to generate `aio_blocklist_final.txt` on a local machine that has Python
- I have tested it on Windows 11, however it should work fine on other OSs too (as long as you have Python installed)

1. Download a ZIP of this repo and extract it to a suitable known folder
2. Create a new empty folder `downloaded_lists` within the `AdGuard-Home-AIO-List-main` folder
3. Edit `create_list.py` in a text editor and change line 20 to set `CURRENTWORKINGDIRECTORY` to a path where `AdGuard-Home-AIO-List-main` exists (save change)
4. Run the script `create_list.py` using `Python`
5. Once the script finishes add the full path of `aio_blocklist_final.txt` to AdGuard Home's `DNS blocklists` as a `custom list`

## Usage

To regenerate the list simply run `create_list.py` when desired (as a scheduled task etc)
